 with Gentoo portage (Quick Example) cd DIR
dev-python/pyjumpcloud ebuild pyjumpcloud-2.x.ebuild rpm ,
/var/temp/portage/dev-python/pyjumpcloud/... yank out RPM , alien can convert it
to deb etc. and or RPM spec etc.

also can take the Autogen  RPMSpec back to Jumpcloud team.

this can be usefull as ebuilds are sligtly easier to me to do. however a one-off RPM and RPMspec which can be cleaned up might be of intrest. 

https://github.com/ascherer/debbuild can also make Debian Packages from the RPMSpecs. /debspecs. 


While I dont care as a Gentoo user (Core-OS , Sabayon, Funtoo , Chrome OS , other Gentoo Cousins...) 
 @ home , in a Corp envior'o.. Centos/RH/debian/Ubuntoo  and Devs tend to care so I'll add whiles testing as a politeness. 
 
 my main Interest is I need jumpcloud for Chroots on Deb/Centos host & or Gentoo chroots.. and home hosts and SSHkey man'gment.. /Vaulting 
 etc without large cluster-hell.. 
 build my security packages , vault my keys etc.. less Admin hell when jumping from Arm64 server to IOT test , main server home AMD64  , gentoo-webhost-www/packages.... etc.. 
 Windows boxes without having Authentication hell.. or being able to deligate users accounts when and were needed to others. and cloud manage them.
 
 
 https://github.com/anatol/gem2arch  can port the PKG to ARCH family .. 
 https://pypi.org/project/pypi2pkgbuild/  for Python. likewise.
